## State

At this point in the project you should be able to build and run the application
in amazon aws, and access it from the outside in a browser.

If you can chat, and new windows opened in the browser get the chat history (means the
database is working).

## Objectives

Understand what you've been doing so far.

* Comment all commands in bash scripts - tell what it does and why
* Comment all "meaningful" lines in dockerfile and docker.compose.yml


Other:
* Set yourself as author in package.json
* Extract the npm build script (all the && delimited commands) into a separate bash script (build.sh), remember to comment this script too.
